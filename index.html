                <h1 class="sub-title">about me</h1>
                <p>Industrial design has been offering me a place where my passions of designing, innovation and creativity can combine since high school. All throughout those early years of studying design I was particularly focused and almost restricted on product design, which didn't completely satisfy my need for invention. I felt the need for initiating a thorough modernisation of the core identity of industrial design in order to make it more nature friendly and eco-oriented. Through identifying myself and my true path as a designer I therefore expanded my mission on inventing products that recognise the severity of the climate crisis we are living in and modern trends we are participating in. Our time here is stained by the mistakes of older generations who have cluttered the planet with unsustainable and cheap materials. The ignorance of humanity has drained our planet. Therefore I have always felt the pressure to change our world for the better and help stop the ignorance of our planet's actual needs as the future of it lies in hands of a younger generation that I feel a part of. Thus the knowledge I'm seeking will help me contribute to minimising the effects of previously exposed problems and creating products that go along with the motive. The sustainability factor in design offers me a more biological and natural aspect of designing new materials that will better serve our planet. And it helps me find alternative solutions for modern ecological problems and encourages me to start replacing old materials for more nature friendly substitutes in hopes that I can continue combining my passion for learning and influencing our world to become kinder through my designs.</p>

                <h2>Throat Sprayer - Concept for TaticDesign Milano</h2>
                <p>The focus of this project was to develop the design (ideation), form (development), (control) and design detailing skills while working with realistic project requirements.<br>
                    <br>
                    We were working on a real project of TaticDesign studio and finding alternative design options for specific user cases. The user case in this scenario was army and military use of the throat spray.<br>
                    <br>
                    Together with Urh Furlanič dipl.ind.obl. we came to this rugged design.</p>

                <h2>Coffee waste management in catering</h2>
                <p>I encountered the problem of an unregulated waste separation system in catering. There, I noticed great potential for recycling coffee waste. Through my project, I started researching the current management of coffee waste. I set myself various options for reusing coffee waste, and delved into the use of coffee waste as a basis for growing nutritious and medicinal mushrooms.<br>
                    <br>
                    Through my project I want to show a new alternative path of coffee waste in the form of a product journey, which acts as a guide for providing a second life cycle to coffee waste. In the practical part of the bachelor's thesis, I monitor and measure the success of growing different types of mushrooms on coffee waste through experiments, and thus prepare ideal substrates for my products.</p>

                <p>A glamping experience inspired by Slovenian beekeeping will enable guests to fully relax and connect with nature.<br>
                <br>
                The Panj glamping unit is surrounded by a parametric wall, which allows complete privacy, but at the same time a view of the morning sun when the guest so desires by manipulating the facade.
                The entire glamping area is surrounded by lush greenery and flowering plants that attract bees. Guests will have the opportunity to learn more about Slovenian beekeeping and participation in educational workshops, as learning how to make honey and getting to know the traditions of bee hives.</p>

                <h2>Planty - returnable sistem</h2>
                <p>The idea for the project was to create a modern twist on a traditional milk bottle design that caters to the rising demand for
                plant-based milk alternatives.<br>
                <br>
                The commitment to sustainability goes beyond just the design. Bottle is supported by a convenient returnable service, allowing users to return empty bottles to their local coffee shop in exchange for a fresh cup of coffee. This promotes a circular economy, reducing single-use plastic waste
                and encouraging reuse.<br>
                <br>
                Glass Bottle is also the perfect vessel for plant-based milk, offering the purest taste without any interference from plastic or other materials. This makes it the ideal choice for specialty coffee shops, where the subtle flavors of coffee and milk can harmoniously blend for a truly exceptional
                experience.</p>

                    <h2>Kaslc</h2>
                    <p>Entering the market and selling their produce is a big challenge for farmers. Due to a lack of time, knowledge or lack of knowledge of price criteria, their products are usually not equipped with communication content that would contain relevant information and convince customers. In this, we propose the Kaslc solution, which comes from the already well-functioning solution of the milking machine, and together with the service we offer, we provide farmers with an easy way to sell to end customers, and we offer them a platform where they can well present the identity of themselves, their farm and their products. With this, we want to enable farmers to make more profit.<br>
                        <br>
                        We provide customers with easy access to local seasonal products, and we want to bring them closer to knowing the origin and quality of only these products.<br>
                        <br>
                        Project is a working progress for a masters thesis in colaboration with Esma Hajderpasić.

                <h2>Mobile galery - sliced up</h2>
                <p>The conceptual design of the mobile gallery is based on container construction, but since a small number of containers are intended for the project, I am looking for a solution in dividing the containers into smaller modules, which can be spread over the entire designated space depending on the size and need.
                    By keeping the rough base of the shipping container, I want to balance this with the fact that the modules are white, which hints at the traditional way of displaying in the "white box" style. I wanted to brighten up the modules with a simple graphic image that comes from the already created logo for previous ALUO exhibitions. The red color of the simple graphics makes a good contrast and attracts the attention of passers-by, and at the same time symbolizes our academy.
                    <br>
                    <br>The modules are designed to periodically change the layout, which would be adapted from exhibition to exhibition.</p>

                <br>
                <br>Boxes are intended for orderly and simple delivery of unprepared food and other raw materials and enable the user to receive an undamaged, stable and organized order right in front of the doorstep.</p>

                <p>As a designer, my initial prototypes and products predominantly utilized paper, cardboard, wood, and metal, allowing me to develop a deep understanding of these materials. However, these familiar mediums also imposed certain limitations on my creativity.
                    <br>
                   <br> An exciting turning point occurred when I was presented with the opportunity to explore the realms of glass and ceramics. This experience expanded my horizons, introducing me to novel materials and showcasing their potential applications in the design process. Working with ceramics exposed me to diverse processing techniques and a myriad of options for product design. Similarly, delving into glass design revealed the vast possibilities inherent in gypsum and mold design.
                    <br>
                    <br>This marked the inception of my venture into experimenting with a diverse range of materials, propelling me to transcend the confines of conventional natural materials in the realm of design.</p>

                <p>While participating in the grape harvest, I noticed the strenuous nature of working in the vineyard, a tradition passed down through multiple generations. Harvesting grapes involves repetitive movements downhill, shifting from a squatting to a semi-bowed position. This repetitive motion can lead to injuries and discomfort in the back and pelvis. Consequently, I aimed to design a simple chair to ease the labor and provide well-deserved rest.
                    <br>
                    <br>Using a single piece of curved oak veneer, I crafted a comfortable chair tailored to provide relief during work. The chair is adapted to fit standard agricultural crates and is suitable for use even in steep terrain, addressing the challenges posed by the vineyard landscape.</p>

                <h2>The Staff Room</h2>
                <p>In the field of film, I worked in visual effects and graphics, which led me to the European hit, the film The staff room (Zbornica). For the film, I animated and illustrated the digital screens that appear throughout the film. In the last two years, the film Zbornica has won two major European awards for the best film, namely the Karlovy Vary Crystal Globe and the Pula Film Festival award.</p>

                <h2>XX - short film</h2>
                <p>Over the course of my studies, I have cultivated a passionate interest in screen printing. This enthusiasm led to a unique opportunity when I was invited to assist Vasja Lebarič, a graphic artist in the field of screen printing. Together, we embarked on an innovative project involving the application of screen printing techniques onto 35mm analog film strips, resulting in the creation of an short experimental analog film.</p>

                <h2>Coffee shop add</h2>
                <p>In my bachelor's thesis, I created a short advertisement film on coffee shops and coffee waste. Taking on the roles of director, producer, and editor, the project served both academic requirements and promoted a local coffee shop. Focused on sustainability and visual storytelling, I orchestrated the production to capture the essence of coffee shops while addressing the issue of coffee waste. 
                    <br>
                    <br>The resulting advertisement became a key element in my thesis and an effective promotional tool for the coffee shop. This project showcased the convergence of academic and practical pursuits, highlighting film's potential to educate and inspire positive change.
